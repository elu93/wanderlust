# Approach

The center of designing this app was a desire to create an intuitive, simple, clean, and elegant experience for the users. I created a relatively simple wireframe, ERD, and data model, but these were fundamental parts of this web app. I wanted my app to reflect the structure I went with in these tools, but have room for improvement on the design-end. I built out my app by meticulously building out each route andview page and then meticulously testing them. This was to ensure that the core functionality was working - after completing all routes, I knew I had a lot of creative freedom to design my user interface. My original wireframe gave me a decent idea of how I wanted it to look, but I was able to quickly pivot and make stylistic decisions when I wanted. After achieving the desired look and feel I had for this web app, I wanted to dig into my icebox and add features that would really enhance the user experience. I decided that adding some subtle image hover effects on the journals and adding a similar rich editor to post the blogs would be this solution. In the interest of time, I didn't do anything else, but the core functionality of the app is working well.

# Unsolved Problems

In terms of user experience, I don't think listing the entire users of the app is a very good starting point. I want to be able to list the blogs that have been submitted which I think will be much more intuitive for a blog/journal site.

# Notes to Self

Add authentication and user sign-up functionalities. Enhance the medium-editor feature and clean up the user interface a bit more.
